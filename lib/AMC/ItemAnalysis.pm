AMC::ItemAnalysis - A suite of auto-multiple-choice plugins for doing item analysis.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.004000_001


=head1 SYNOPSIS

From the AMC GUI, go to the Reports tab and select one of the "Item Analysis"
options from the dropdown menu.  Click "Export" and after completion, open the
F<exports> directory.  A file called F<foo-item-analysis.ext> will be there,
where F<foo> is the "short name" of your AMC project, and F<ext> depends on 
which format you have chosen.

From the command line, you can execute

	auto-multiple-choice export --module ItemAnalysis_ext \
	    --data project-data-dir \
        --fich-noms students-list.csv \
        --o output-file

Here C<ext> is one of C<LaTeX> or C<YAML>, depending on your desired output
format.
