Revision history for AMC-ItemAnalysis

0.6     2018-12-18
        Renamed a key “histogram” to “responses”.  This is a ackwards-
        incompatible change.

        Improved detection of open (free response) questions.

        Improved box plot for open questions, with fancier style and plotting
        of outliers.

        Various code improvements.
        

0.5     2018-12-07
        Open questions are now visualized with box-and-whisker plots instead of
        bar charts.  
        
        Added documentation in Sphinx.

        Mild GUI improvements.  Namely, inoperative controls are removed.

        Various bugs and typos fixed.

0.4     2017-11-27
        Questions are now sorted by database order.  This should be pretty close
        to catalog order.  Likely the most desired order.

0.3     2018-11-25
        Answer labels (A, B, C, ...) are now reported when available.

        Some code cleanup.

        Code refactoring to include separate export modules for separate
        formats.
